  # I can change the namespace and take in my mind the other jaeger components
  # which are in the default namespace

  # When you create this PersistentVolumeClaim with 
# kubectl apply -f pvc-demo.yaml, Kubernetes dynamically 
# creates a corresponding PersistentVolume object. 
# Assuming that you haven't replaced the GKE default 
# storage class, this PersistentVolume is backed by a 
# new, empty Compute Engine persistent disk. 
# You use this disk in a Pod by using the claim as a volume.

# When you delete this claim, the corresponding PersistentVolume 
# object as well as the provisioned Compute Engine persistent disk 
# are also deleted.
# Should you want to prevent deletion of dynamically provisioned 
# persistent disks, set the reclaim policy 
# (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#reclaim-policy) 
# of the PersistentVolume resource, or its StorageClass resource, to Retain. 
# In this case, you are charged for the persistent disk for as 
# long as it exists even if there is no PersistentVolumeClaim consuming it.
